## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to position elements on the screen based on the flexbox layout that I want. I also used Javascript for adding custom styles for the classes when listening to events. I really liked how easy it was using loops:

```js
for (let index = 0; index < options.length; index++) {
  options[index].addEventListener("click", () => {
    clearAll();
    selectedOption = index;
    options[index].classList.replace(
      "rating__scale--option--selectable",
      "rating__scale--option--active"
    );
  });
}
```

### Continued development

I am not totally comfortable with responsive styling. So that is an area that I want to improve on future challenges.
